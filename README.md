# SELMA3D 2026: Example for building a container image of your algorithm for Preliminary Development Phase Task without SSL

### Step 1: Implement your solution  
* In [requirements.txt](requirements.txt), list the packages required for your solution.
* In [inference.py](inference.py), `load_image_file_as_array` function will automatically load the testing image once you submit your algorithm container. Do not change the [image reading](inference.py#L126) and [saving](inference.py#L151) parts.
  
* Modify the [processing part](inference.py#L130) in inference.py file to preprocess the input image and define the model.
* Put the model weights the [model folder](model), then modify the [model part](inference.py#L89) in inference.py file to load the resources.
* Modify the [prediction part](inference.py#L135) in inference.py file, replacing it with your solution to make a prediction for the loaded image array.

### Step 2: Test locally
* Call the [do test_run](do_test_run.sh) bash script using the command:
        ```./do_test_run.sh```

  This will start the inference and reads from [/test/input](/test/input) and outputs to /test/output.
### Step 3: Save the container image for Grand Challenge submission
*  Call the [do save](do_save.sh) bash script using the command:
        ```./do_save.sh```

   This will create a container image of the algorithm.
### Step 4 : Use the github repo for Grand Challenge submission (optional) 
*  Fork this repository to a new repository under your GitHub account.
*  In your repository, complete Step 1 and Step 2 to implement and test your solution.
*  Follow the instructions below for submitting to the Grand Challenge (you may need to copy and paste the link into your browser to access it):
